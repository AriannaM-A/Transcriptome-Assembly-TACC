These samples were chosen because they came from the same lab and the treatment each sample recieved was documented. In order to cover the full range of gene expression, 3 samples each were chosen from the light and dark treatments with varying degrees of acclimation to light and darkness. The length of the samples was also a factor behind their selection to ensure that enough memory was allocated to each assembler.
