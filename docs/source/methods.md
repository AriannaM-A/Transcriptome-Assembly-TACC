# Methods

#### Data Retrieval
Raw sequencing data were obtained from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Accession metadata and associated experimental conditions were compiled into a structured CSV file for downstream use. FASTQ files were retrieved using **SRA Toolkit**, ensuring checksum verification and consistent download behavior in the HPC environment.

#### Read Quality Control
Initial quality assessment of raw reads was performed with **fastp**, which conducted adapter trimming, quality filtering, and removal of low-complexity sequences. Per-sample quality reports generated by fastp were complemented with **FastQC** summaries to evaluate sequence quality, GC content, and duplication profiles. These reports were aggregated using **MultiQC** to provide a unified overview of preprocessing results.

#### Transcriptome Assembly
De novo transcriptome assembly was performed using two independent assemblers to ensure robustness in transcript reconstruction. Preliminary assemblies were generated with **SPAdes** in RNA-Seq mode. Final assemblies were produced using **Trinity**, which incorporates read partitioning and de Bruijn graph optimization to improve transcript recovery, particularly in isoform-rich datasets.

#### Coding Region Identification
Putative open reading frames (ORFs) and coding sequences were identified with **TransDecoder**, which detects likely protein-coding regions using intrinsic sequence metrics and optional homology evidence. Longest ORFs and predicted peptide sequences were extracted for downstream annotation.

#### Transcript Quantification
Transcript abundance estimation was carried out using **Salmon** in quasi-mapping mode. Reads were mapped back to the assembled transcriptome to generate TPM and count matrices for downstream QC and expression analysis.

#### Functional Annotation
Functional annotation was performed with **EnTAP**, which integrates homology searches, protein domain identification, contaminant filtering, and Gene Ontology (GO) assignment. EnTAP was supplied with the predicted TransDecoder peptide dataset to generate high-confidence functional annotations.

#### Assembly Completeness Assessment
Completeness of the assembled transcriptome was evaluated using **BUSCO**, applying an appropriate eukaryotic or algal lineage dataset. BUSCO scores were calculated based on the presence of expected single-copy orthologs, providing an independent measure of assembly quality.
