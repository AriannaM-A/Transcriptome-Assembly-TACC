This repository documents the entire workflow of de novo transcriptome assembly using the organism *Fragilariopsis cylindrus* on the Texas Advanced Computing Center's Stampede3 supercomputer. This project spanned 6 months and was undertaken through the NSF-Leadership Class Computing Facility internship through TACC. The overall goal of the project was to come up with a scalable, reproducible pipeline for de novo transcriptome assembly that is optimized for TACC systems. The result of this project is a fully assembled transcriptome for the diatom, *F. cylindrus*, as well as a containerized pipeline for de novo transcriptome assembly from start to finish.
